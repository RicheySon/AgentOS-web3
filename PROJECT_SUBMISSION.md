# AgentOS-Web3: The Complete Autonomous AI Agent Platform

## 🚀 Elevation Pitch
**AgentOS-Web3** is the first production-ready backend operating system designed to give AI agents a secure identity, intelligent capabilities, and immortal memory. By integrating **AWE Network**, **ChainGPT**, and **Unibase**, we provide the safety rails and infrastructure needed for the autonomous agent economy.

---

## 💡 What We Built
AgentOS-Web3 integrates three major hackathon featured technologies into one cohesive system:

### 1. AWE Network Integration (Identity & Payments)
*   **Network:** Base Sepolia
*   **Identity:** ERC-8004 On-chain Identity NFTs for every agent.
*   **Payments:** x402 Payment Protocol enabling real USDC micropayments.
*   **Reputation:** On-chain tracking of agent performance and trustworthiness.
*   **Smart Contract:** Custom `ERC8004AgentIdentity.sol` implementation.

### 2. Quack × ChainGPT Integration (AI Intelligence)
*   **Network:** BNB Testnet
*   **Web3 Research:** AI-powered explanations of DeFi protocols and tokens.
*   **Smart Contract Gen:** Natural language to Solidity code generation.
*   **Automated Auditing:** Real-time security analysis and risk assessment.
*   **DeFi Execution:** Autonomous token swaps, staking, and contract interactions.

### 3. Unibase Integration (Immortal Memory)
*   **Network:** Membase Hub
*   **Persistent Storage:** All agent interactions are stored permanently.
*   **User Preferences:** Agents remember settings and context across sessions.
*   **Audit Trail:** Complete verifiable logging of all actions.
*   **Decentralized:** Sovereign data ownership for every agent.

## 🏗️ Architecture
User requests flow through our **REST API**, which orchestrates the interaction between the three core pillars:
1.  **Identity Layer:** Connects to AWE Network (Base Sepolia) to verify agent identity and process payments.
2.  **Intelligence Layer:** Consults ChainGPT (BNB Testnet) for reasoning, code generation, and market analysis.
3.  **Memory Layer:** Reads/Writes to Unibase (Membase) to maintain context and history.

**Result:** A unified, stateless backend that powers complex, multi-step agent workflows.

## 🌟 Key Innovations

### 1. First Triple-Integration Platform
We are the unique project combining **AWE + ChainGPT + Unibase** with seamless multi-network support (Base Sepolia + BNB Testnet) via a single unified API.

### 2. Zero Mock Data (Real Implementation)
*   **Live AI:** Realtime responses from ChainGPT API.
*   **Real Money:** Executing actual USDC ERC-20 transfers on Base.
*   **Real Storage:** Decentralized persistence on Membase.
*   **Real Blockchain:** Verifiable on-chain transactions.

### 3. Production-Ready Backbone
*   **Secure:** Comprehensive security audit completed.
*   **Scalable:** Stateless architecture designed for high throughput.
*   **Documented:** 14 comprehensive guides included.
*   **Testable:** Complete test suite achieving high coverage.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express
*   **Blockchain Interfaces:** Web3.js, Viem
*   **AI Engine:** ChainGPT API
*   **Storage:** Membase SDK
*   **Networks:** Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532), BNB Testnet (Chain ID: 97)
*   **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (ERC-8004 Identity, ERC-20 USDC)

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. DeFi Portfolio Manager
An agent that researches protocols via AI, generates custom trading strategies, executes swaps automatically, and tracks performance history in memory.

### 2. Smart Contract Assistant
An agent that accepts natural language descriptions, generates Solidity code, audits it for security flaws, deploys it to the blockchain, and logs the deployment address.

### 3. Autonomous Trading Agent
An agent that analyzes market conditions, executes trades based on pre-set parameters, accepts payment for premium signals, and maintains a public trading record.
